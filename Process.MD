The Oak Tree Flake team will be using the agile method of software development (similar to the one used in ICS 314)
In general process of agile development a software team would usually focus on:

1. sit down a list of features, they would like to see in their software ordered by customers or users. Then call these features user stories and they become the To Do list for the project.

2. Then, using Agile estimation techniques, the team will size user stories relatively to each other, coming up with a guess as to how long they think each user story will take.

3. Like most lists, there always seems to be more to do than time allows. So the team will ask the customer to prioritize their list so you get the most important stuff done first, and save the least important for last.

4. The team starts delivering some value. They start at the top. Work their way to the bottom. Building, iterating, and getting feedback from the customer as they go.

Then, as the team starts delivering, one of two things is going to happen. You'll discover:

They are going fast enough. All is good. Or, they have too much to do and not enough time.
At this point they have two choices. they can either a) do less and cut scope (recommended). Or they can b) push out the date and ask for more money.

In our project: 
* Team conduct meetings to evaluate the “issues” to work on
* “Issues” or the next implementations will be worked on
* The team would then decide whether or not “next cycle” needs to be done, if yes, then the process starts again from the first bullet point
